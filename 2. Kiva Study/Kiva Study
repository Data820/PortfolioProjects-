# Kiva is a non-profit organization that is headquartered in San Francisco, California. They allow users to lend money to entrepreneurs and students in many different 
# countries around the world. This data looks at a set of countries that have received loans from Kiva. 



# 1. Import Python Modules
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt 
import pandas as pd 
import seaborn as sns 



#2. Load data frame and check it 

df =pd.read_csv('C:\kiva_data.csv')
df.head()

print(df.head(25))


#3. Examine the average amount of loans to each country through the use of a Bar plot. 

f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))

sns.barplot(data=df, x="country", y="loan_amount")
plt.show()



#4. Adding the $ symbol to the chart

import matplotlib.ticker as mtick
f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(15, 10))
sns.barplot(data=df, x="country", y = "loan_amount")
fmt = '${x:,.0f}'
tick = mtick.StrMethodFormatter(fmt)
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(tick) 



#5. Bar Chart Data Assessments 

#1. Males received larger average loan amounts.
#2. El Salvador has the least amount of gender disparity in terms of loans. 
#3. Kiva should try to decrease the gender gap in loans given to males and females. 


#6.Styling the chart 


sns.set_palette("Accent")
sns.set_style("whitegrid")
plt.figure(figsize=(25, 15))
plt.title("Average Loan Amounts Given by Kiva, by country, by gender (in $ USD)")
sns.barplot(data=df, x="country", y="loan_amount", hue="gender")



#7. Creating a box plot to view loan distribution by country

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x="country", y="loan_amount")
plt.show()



#8. Box Plot Assessments

 # 1. Kenya has the widest distribution of loans of the countries in the dataset. 
 # 2.  You would receive the highest loan in Cambodia. 
 
 
# 9. Creating a box plot that visualizes the distribution of loans by activity.

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))

sns.boxplot(data=df, x="activity", y="loan_amount")
plt.show()

#10. Box Plot by Activity Assessment

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))

sns.violinplot(data=df, x="activity", y = "loan_amount")
plt.show()

# 11. Violin Plot by activity 

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))

sns.violinplot(data=df, x="activity", y = "loan_amount")
plt.show()


#12. Violin Plot by country. 

plt.figure(figsize=(16, 10))

sns.violinplot(data=df, x="country", y = "loan_amount")
plt.show()

# 13. Split violin plots that uses gender as the hue parameter.

sns.set_palette("Spectral")
plt.figure(figsize=(18, 12))

sns.violinplot(data=df, x="country", y = "loan_amount", hue="gender", split=True)
plt.show()


# 14.  Box plot data assessments 


 # 1. The average loan for men in Pakistan is greater than the average amount given to women. 
 # 2. The average loan for men in Cambodia is greater than the average amount given to women. 
 # 3. Loan amounts between men and women are similar in El Salvador.
